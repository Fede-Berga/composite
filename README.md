# Composite

In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Installation - the easy (maybe) way

1.  **Clone the repository** 

    Clone the repo and move into the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**  

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    * Activate the virtual environment on **macOS/Linux**:

        ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    
    * Activate the virtual environment on **Windows**:

        ```bash
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    Install the required packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the script**

    Now you can run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python path/to/your_script.py
    ```

## Installation - the harder (maybe) way

1. Install Docker:

2. type the command:

    ```bash
    docker compose up 
    ```
